# Vector Search Using Open AI
This repository belong to CRUD operations using Piencone Vector Database. In this app I use React JS for front-end and Express JS using for APIs. Also using Open AI for vector conversion of data. Also the interesting thing is there vector search you can search by any relevent word in whole document. Like you can post a blog about coffee and you can serach you blog by simply writing tea or coffee releated words in search box so you can find the blog.
